##  About Me

After a decade in logistics and supply chain, I transitioned into software engineering to build meaningful, efficient systems. I recently completed the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive, where I built full-stack web applications using:

- React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- Git, GitHub, Netlify, Vercel

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems and building tools that automate operations, visualize data, or improve user experience.
